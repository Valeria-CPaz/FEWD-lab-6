		<h1>The Witcher 3</h1>
		<p>The Witcher 3 is a RPG released in 2015: This is by far one of the best games I've ever played. Even though
			is a game from 2015 (I've rarely play a
			game when it's released - AKA = I'm poor) is still an excelent game today.
			The Game of The Year edition that I've purchased contain both DLCs 'Hearts of Stone' and 'Blood and Wine'. I
			laughed, I felt angry, I wanted to through my controller against the wall. Everything you want in a game.
			155 hours of pure joy.

		<h1>The Last of Us part 2</h1>
		<p>The Last of us part 2 is an action-adventure game released in 2020: I've played The Last of us in 2013 and I
			remember how mind blowing this was back then. The graphics were
			absolutely amazing and the game was accoladed as it should. Now, 7 years later, Naughty Dog releases the
			part 2
			of a very loved game. I play games for a long time now and I can say that I've never felt with any other
			game
			what I did with The Last of Us part 2. Naughty Dog is already well known for making narrative games, but
			with this title they made me feel
			happy, angry and uncomfortable all the time. The plot is about revenge and the power of letting go. In my
			opinion, it doesn't really matter if you're a
			gamer or not. Everybody should play this master piece and maybe understand that there's much more behind a
			game than just a good gameplay.

		<img id="game_image" src="images/img2.jpg" alt="Mass Effect Andromeda" title="3 gameplay images of Mass Effect Andromeda"/>
		<h1>Mass Effect Andromeda</h1>
		<p>Mass Effect Andromeda is an action-RPG released in 2017: The original Mass Effect Trilogy is one of my
			favourite games ever. They had a lot of problems and bugs, but
			the universe that Bioware created was so amazing that it didn't really matter. Mass
			Effect Andromeda was supposed to be a new game with new characters in a new galaxy, but I have to say,
			it is not as good as the original one. Not even close. I am currently playing this game and even though
			now I kinda like it, it gets too boring too frequently. And when I remember the original trilogy,
			where I really cared about the characters and wanted to know everything about them, now I find myself in a
			"I just want to finish it" fase. Which is sad. But hey, maybe is my own fault. I mean, I started to play
			this after I finished The Last of Us part 2, which is not even fair. They are not the same genre, of course.
			But still. 49 hours into this game and I'm not even close to finish.
